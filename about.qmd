I am a fourth year Finance Student at the University of Alberta. Throughout my time at the Alberta School of Business, I have gained deep experience through both co-op terms and internships, as well as through my participation in valuable courses offered in the Finance program at the University.

My professional principles include attention to detail, discipline, and collaboration.

My professional interests include trading, financial research, and data analytics for financial decision making.

My personal interests include guitar improvisation with influence from famous blues players like Stevie Ray Vaughan, board games, programming, and finance.
